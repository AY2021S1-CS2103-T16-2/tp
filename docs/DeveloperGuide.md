### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Insurance Agents - Financial Advisors
Insurance agents represent insurance companies, such as AIA and Prudential, as their sales person. They bring in 
clients and promote various insurance schemes. Their clients could be individuals or other businesses. Insurance agents’ 
mode of conducting their job generally involves talking directly to these clients in a face-to-face setting and giving 
their pitch. 

Insurance agents need to be familiar with their clients’ profile, such as their family status, financial needs and 
interests, to better promote their insurance schemes as it gives their pitch a personal touch. 

These users are likely used to typing notes and formulas to manage their clients into a tracker, for example in  Excel 
notebooks. They would add in attributes of users into the tracker, and add in additional functionalities using formulas. 
Thus, they are likely to be comfortable in using a command-line interface.

**Value proposition**: 

Remembering people like a good neighbour.

Successful Financial advisors can have more than a hundred clients. They may not be able to remember the personal 
details of all their clients at once. This product aims to provide a command-line interface for the financial agent to 
record the details of the client, from their scheme details, such as the policies they own, to their personal details, 
like their hobbies. As such, they would be better prepared for meetings and are able to provide a personal touch when 
giving their pitch.
